Running the APK

Steps

1) This gaming application starts off by displaying a canon ball waiting for launch and also displays two buttons namely Quit and Reset
2) Type in the initial velocity and angle in degrees and click Enter
3) If the velocity and angle is good enough you can see cannon ball continuously firing from left bottom corner
4) Then touch the screen and move it at the desired location to place the pirate ship a.k.a the Target
5) Once the canon ball hits the pirate ship it stops firing canon balls
6) Click Reset to reload the game with the previously set velocity and angle.
7) Again you can place the pirate ship and change velocity and angle to hit the target
8) Quit will gracefully exit the application
